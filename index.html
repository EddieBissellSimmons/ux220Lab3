            Megamind
        </h2>
        <p>
            The best movie I have watched recently was Megamind. Although I initially watched Megamind when it first
            came out, I gained a new-found appreciation for the movie in my recent re-watch. The movie is about
            Megamind, an alien super genius who came to Earth after his planet was destroyed, and his journey from
            villain to hero. In my opinion the movie was very ahead of its time and acts as a parody for modern
            superhero movies even though it came out one year before the first Avengers movie, which began the superhero
            craze.

        <h2>
            Synopsis
        </h2>
        <p>
            The story begins with Megamind and Metro Man venturing to Earth as new-born babies after their planet was destroyed (parodying Superman). Metro Man crash lands in a wealthy family’s house and Megamind crashes into a prison. Throughout the film it is shown how being raised in these vastly different places affected how they see themselves, Metro man thinks he is the good guy and can do no wrong, whereas Megamind thinks he is the bad guy that cannot be good. This is further explored with the two characters clashing throughout the film and exploring who they want to be, with the film ending with Megamind becoming the hero of Metro City and Metro man retiring and pursuing his passion of making music.

        <h2>
            My Favourite Aspects
        </h2>
        <p>
            While watching the movie I enjoyed the wacky over-exaggerated animation that adds to the storytelling and
            laughs. The surprisingly deep relationship between characters, that show rather than tell. But most
            importantly, the jokes that shouldn’t be as funny as they are. Some of the songs I thought added to the film
            were: Mr. Blue Sky by Electric Light Orchestra, Back in Black by AC/DC, and Welcome to the Jungle by Guns n’
            Roses. The actors that made the characters feel alive were: Will Farrel, Jonah Hill, Tina Fey, and Brad
            Pitt.
